# Privacy Policy

This app connects to your Office account via an OAuth login.  That means your login and password are never shared with the app.  Only Windows manages the communication to get access.

This app requires read/write access to your OneDrive account to function.  This app will only read file and folder names, sizes of files, creation date and cryptographic hashes.  None of these are stored in a cache file and will disappear as soon as the app is closed.  The app will *never* download a file's contents.  

This app is capable of deleting a large number of files at a time.  All efforts have been made to ensure that only duplicates of files are deleted.  You will retain one copy of the file.  However, if you are uneasy about this, all deleted files are moved to the Recycling Bin on OneDrive itself.  They are available to be restored up to 30 days after being deleted.

This app is free.  Source code is public and viewable in the repository.  No data is ever collected.
